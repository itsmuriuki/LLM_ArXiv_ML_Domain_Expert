  <h1>üèõ LLM ArXiv ML Domain Expert</h1>
  <p>A LLM system trained on ArXiv papers to create a Machine Learning domain expert</p>
  
  
  <p><em>In this project the aim is to build an LLM system trained on ArXiv papers to create a Machine Learning domain expert with robust MLOps architecture and best practices. We will finetune a Llama 1b  with data from arxiv papers through a complete academic paper processing pipeline made possible with <a href="https://ds4sd.github.io/docling/">docling</a> a library developed by IBM.</em></p>

`llm_engineering/` is the main Python package implementing LLM and RAG
functionality. It follows Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles:

- `domain/`: Core business entities and structures
- `application/`: Business logic, crawlers, and RAG implementation
- `model/`: LLM training and inference
- `infrastructure/`: External service integrations (AWS, Qdrant, MongoDB,
  FastAPI)

The code logic and imports flow as follows: `infrastructure` ‚Üí `model` ‚Üí
`application` ‚Üí `domain`

`pipelines/`: Contains the ZenML ML pipelines, which serve as the entry
point for all the ML pipelines. Coordinates the data processing and model
training stages of the ML lifecycle.

`steps/`: Contains individual ZenML steps, which are reusable components for building and customizing ZenML pipelines. Steps perform specific tasks (e.g., data loading, preprocessing) and can be combined within the ML pipelines.

`tests/`: Covers a few sample tests used as examples within the CI
pipeline.

`tools/`: Utility scripts used to call the ZenML pipelines and inference
code:

- `run.py`: Entry point script to run ZenML pipelines.
- `ml_service.py`: Starts the REST API inference server.
- `rag.py`: Demonstrates usage of the RAG retrieval module.
- `data_warehouse.py`: Used to export or import data from the MongoDB data warehouse through JSON files.

`configs/`: ZenML YAML configuration files to control the execution of pipelines and steps.

`code_snippets/`: Independent code examples that can be executed independently.

## üíª Installation

### 1. Clone and Setup

1. First, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danivpv/arxiv-domain-expert-llm.git
cd arxiv-domain-expert-llm
```

2. Then, install the dependencies:

```bash
uv sync
```

3. Optionally, if you plan to commit code, you can install the `pre-commit` hooks:

```bash
uv sync --extra dev
uv run pre-commit install
```

4. Optionally, activate the virtual environment. Although `uv run` will automatically discover the virtual environment of the project, this is necessary to get the right interpreter using `which python` as expected by other workflows with `venv`, `pip`, `poetry`, etc...

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

As our task manager (similar to `Makefile`), we run all the scripts using [Poe the Poet](https://poethepoet.natn.io/index.html) defined in the `tool.poe.tasks` section on the `pyproject.toml` file.

```bash
uv run poe ...
```

### 2. Local Development Setup

After you have installed all the dependencies, you must create and fill a¬†`.env` file with your credentials to appropriately interact with other services and run the project. Remember to add the file to your `.gitignore` file to keep it secret.

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
HUGGINGFACE_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_token_here
COMET_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

> Details on how to obtain appropiate credentials can be found in the official [repository](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/LLM-Engineers-Handbook) and [book](https://www.amazon.com/LLM-Engineers-Handbook-engineering-production/dp/1836200072/).

### 3. Deployment Setup

When deploying the project to the cloud, we must set additional settings for Mongo, Qdrant, and AWS. If you are just working locally, the default values of these env vars will work out of the box.

```env
DATABASE_HOST=your_mongodb_url
USE_QDRANT_CLOUD=true
QDRANT_CLOUD_URL=your_qdrant_cloud_url
QDRANT_APIKEY=your_qdrant_api_key
AWS_REGION=eu-central-1 # Change it with your AWS region.
AWS_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_access_key
AWS_SECRET_KEY=your_aws_secret_key
```

> Details on how to obtain appropiate credentials can be found in the official [repository](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/LLM-Engineers-Handbook) and [book](https://www.amazon.com/LLM-Engineers-Handbook-engineering-production/dp/1836200072/).

## üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure

> More details on local and cloud infrastructure setups are available in the official [repository](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/LLM-Engineers-Handbook) and [book](https://www.amazon.com/LLM-Engineers-Handbook-engineering-production/dp/1836200072/).

## üèÉ Run project

Based on the setup and usage steps described above, assuming the local and cloud infrastructure works and the `.env` is filled as expected, follow the next steps to run the LLM system end-to-end:

### Data

- [x] Collect data: `uv run poe run-arxiv-data-etl`

- [x] Compute features: `uv run poe run-feature-engineering-pipeline`

- [x] Compute instruct dataset: `uv run poe run-generate-instruct-datasets-pipeline`

- [x] Compute preference alignment dataset: `uv run poe run-generate-preference-datasets-pipeline`

### Training

> From now on, for these steps to work, you need to properly set up AWS SageMaker, such as running `uv sync --extra aws` and filling in the AWS-related environment variables and configs.

- [x] SFT fine-tuning Llamma 3.1: `uv run poe run-training-pipeline`

- [x] For DPO, go to `configs/training.yaml`, change `finetuning_type` to `dpo`, and run `uv run poe run-training-pipeline` again

- [x] Evaluate fine-tuned models: `uv run poe run-evaluation-pipeline`

### Inference

> From now on, for these steps to work, you need to properly set up AWS SageMaker, such as running `uv sync --extra aws` and filling in the AWS-related environment variables and configs.

- [x] Call only the RAG retrieval module: `uv run poe call-rag-retrieval-module`

- [x] Deploy the LLM Twin microservice to SageMaker: `uv run poe deploy-inference-endpoint`

- [x] Test the LLM Twin microservice: `uv run poe test-sagemaker-endpoint`

- [x] Start end-to-end RAG server: `uv run poe run-inference-ml-service`

- [ ] Test RAG server: `uv run poe call-inference-ml-service`
